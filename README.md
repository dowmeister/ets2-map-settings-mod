# ETS2 Map settings Mod

This work starts from [Funbit mod](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=186779&start=20#p405122), that's no working with ETS2 latest version.

With some tweaks i made the mod working on 1.30 

It's better to use a fresh profile with no mods, and select simple background from Gameplay options.

Tested on 1920x1080 px .

World map will appear like this:
